- What is data structures? - A way to keep stores our data in a structured way.

*Arrays in java*

- Through arrays we can create - stack , ques , Deque ,
- index starts from 0 in array
- if one array is for int then int number's will be stores not any other this was applicable for all other things like audio , float.

*Limitations of array*

- If we want to add any mumber in the end of array box is an easy task to do but if add any number in between its time taking.

- So the end deletion / insertion is easy in array but in between is time taking becos property of array is continous.

- We can't delete or insert on random place in an array.

* But random access is possible in an array by index for ex - a[3], here 3 represent index of box.

*LinkedList in java*

- Through linkedlist we can create - hashmaps , sets , trees , graphs

- Linkedlist m data is not inclined means ek line m data nhi rehta uski postions alg alg hoti h 

- mean ek ldka 1 pr h ek 20 , ek , 30 or ek 50 pr diff positions pr h sb ab kya krenge 1 bale ko bta denge ki second wala kaha h (20) , second wale ko bta denge 3 wala kaha h (30) or last wale m null kr denge kyuki next koi h he nhi. So aise krke hum jump krte rhte h.

- Ab idr ldka or 20 dono ko hum nodes kehte h jisme ldka data h or uske sath dusri position ka link h jo another ldke se connect krega.

- A linked list is a type of linear data structure individual items are not necessarily at contiguous locations. The individual items are called nodes and connected with each other using links.

- A node contains two things first is data and second is a link that connects it with another node.

- The first node is called the head node and we can traverse the whole list using this head and next links.
