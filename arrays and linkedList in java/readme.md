- What is data structures? - A way to keep stores our data in a structured way.

*Arrays in java*

- Through arrays we can create - stack , ques , Deque ,
- index starts from 0 in array
- if one array is for int then int number's will be stores not any other this was applicable for all other things like audio , float.

*Limitations of array*

- If we want to add any mumber in the end of array box is an easy task to do but if add any number in between its time taking.

- So the end deletion / insertion is easy in array but in between is time taking becos property of array is continous.

- We can't delete or insert on random place in an array.

*LinkedList in java*

- Through linkedlist we can create - hashmaps , sets , trees , graphs
