// Ques :-  An Unsorted array , we need to 2 numbers whose sum is equal to given target and don't use exta space? In this ques 2 pointer was used.

// [2,5,1,7,3] unsorted array index

// [1,2,3,5,7] sorted array , after sorting is allowed becos in ques return pair of numbers demanded
  
// i + j = 1+7 = 8 , here 8 is not equal to the target sum then return nhi krenge here we need to change iteration position of i or j acc to the 3 possibilites :-

// find target sum = 6 , output = 8 , if 8 == 6 then return kr denge , if 8<6 then change iteration postion , if 8>6 then also changed iteration position of i and j
